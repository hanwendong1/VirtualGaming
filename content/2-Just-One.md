#### Description
Just One is a cooperative party game. You all play together to get the best score!

Together, make one of the players – the active player – guess a Mystery word by secretly writing a clue. 

Choose your clue without coordinating with each other and be original so as not to write the same clue as another player, as all identical clues will be canceled before the active player gets to see them.

At the end of the game, tally your score based on the number of Mystery words found.

##### INVALID CLUES
- Deliberately spelling a word incorrectly – Spelling ‘shurt’ for shirt.
- Substituting a foreign word with the same meaning as the word in question – using amor to describe love.
- Using a word from the same family as the mystery word – Princely when the mystery word is prince.
- Completely made up words – Sweet'ing to describe cake.
- A phonetically identical word to the mystery word – A clue cannot be knight if the mystery word is night.

##### IDENTICAL CLUES
- Identical
  - Cow, cow, COW
- Same derivation
  - Cow, cows
  - Philosophy, philosopher 

#### GAME END
Gameplay continues until either endgame condition is met:
- First team to have all their words covered wins 
- The team that contacts the assassin instantly loses
