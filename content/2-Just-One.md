#### Description
Just One is a cooperative party game. You all play together to get the best score!

Together, make one of the players – the active player – guess a Mystery word by secretly writing a clue. 

Choose your clue without coordinating with each other and be original so as not to write the same clue as another player, as all identical clues will be canceled before the active player gets to see them.

At the end of the game, tally your score based on the number of Mystery words found.

#### Goal

We work as a team to get the best score!

#### SETUP
1. Log in to the site
2. Click `Guest account`, then enter a player name 
3. Click the open room that was just created

#### GAMEPLAY
A mystery word will be randomly chosen for the active player to guess. All other palyers, without communicating with each other and without writes one clue that is composed of a ***single word***.

{% capture text %}Note: a number (007), an acronym (SMS), an onomatopoeia (meow), or a special character ($) are all considered to be words.
{% endcapture %} {% include alert.md text=text color="warning" %}

{% capture text %}
Can you guess what the mystry word is?
{% endcapture %}
{% include card.md text=text header="Example clues to guess the mystry word" img="JO_EN01_Content01.png" %}


##### INVALID CLUES
- Deliberately spelling a word incorrectly – Spelling ‘shurt’ for shirt
- Written in a foreign language – using buisson to describe bush
- Using a word from the same family as the mystery word – princess when the mystery word is prince
- Completely made up words – Sweet'ing to describe cake
- A phonetically identical word – A clue cannot be knight if the mystery word is night

##### IDENTICAL CLUES
- Identical - Cow, cow, COW
- Same derivation - Cow, cows; Philosophy, philosopher 

Invalid and identical clues will be canceled. The active player tries to guess the mystery word, but they are allowed only ***one guess***. The team scores one point if the active player correctly guesses the Mystery word. Then another player becomes the new active player and a new turn begins.

#### GAME END
The game ends after 13 rounds. Count the number of successfully guessed cards and compare your total with this table to get your score:
