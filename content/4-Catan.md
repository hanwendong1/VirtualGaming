#### Description
"Insider" combines two fun components: finding the answer to a quiz and revealing the Insider. 

While communicating to others you have to find the right answers to a quiz and also find the "Insider" that is manipulating the discussion. 

The Insider will do everything to hide their identity while misleading the others.

#### Goal

Be the first player to acquire 10 victory points on your turn!

Settlement = 1 VP 

City = 2 VP 

VP card = 1 VP 

Longest Road or Larget Army = 2 VP

#### SETUP
1. Log in to the site
2. Enter a player name 
3. You begin the game by placing one settlement and one connecting road, then another settlement and another connecting road.
4. Receive the resources in the terrain hexes adjacent to your second settlement. 

#### GAMEPLAY

On your turn, you will roll two dice. The number rolled determines which terrain hexes produce resources for all players. Then, you can build roads, settlements, and cities, buy development cards, or trade with other players.

**Produce Resource**
Building settlements & cities produce resources. Resources are produced when any player does a dice roll. Whomever has a settlement or a city in the border of the dice number will receive the resource shown in the tile. Settlements produce 1 resource, cities produce 2 resources.

Rolling 7 & Robber
When a player rolls a 7, they get to place the robber on any tile they wish and steal 1 random card from any of the colors adjacent to that tile. Robber prevents gaining resource from the tile it is on.

Use Resources
Resources could be used in 5 ways;

Build Road: Lumber & Brick

Build Settlement: Lumber, Brick, Wool, Grain

Build City: Grainx2, Orex3

Buy Development Card: Wool, Grain, Ore

Trade with other players

Development Cards
Knight: Place robber in any tile and steal 1 card from an adjacent tile.

Year of Plenty: Take 2 cards you want from bank.

Road Building: Build 2 roads.

Monopoly: Steal all instances of a single type of card from every player.

Victory Point: Gain 1 victory point.

Trade
Bank: On default you can give 4 of the same type of card to obtain 1 of any other type.

Bank with Ports: If you have a settlement or city near a port you automatically use that ports specialty. If you have 3:1 it means that you can trade 3 of the same type of card to obtain 1 of any other type. If you have 2:1, then you can trade 2 of the corresponding type to obtain 1 of any other card.

Longest Road
The player with the longest consecutive road earns 2 victory points. A minimum of 5 consecutive roads need to be placed in order to get this bonus.

Largest Army
The player to use the most amount of Knight cards earns 2 victory points. A minimum of 3 Knight cards needs to be used in order to get this bonus.

Points

- City: 2 points

- Longest Road: 2 points

- Largest Army: 2 points

{% capture text %}
"Is it an animal?" - "No"

"Was it existent 100 years ago?" - "I don't know"

"Can I buy it at the supermarket?" - "Yes"
{% endcapture %}
{% include card.md text=text header="Example questions" img="insider_example.jpg" %}

The players have to find the answer by asking many questions. Any player can ask any number of questions. They only have 5 minutes to find it though. 

The Insider tries to stay incognito and controlls the others asking questions that will help them to get closer to the right answer. If someone notices who he/she is, he/she will lose, so it is very important to stay unrecognized.

{% capture text %}Tip for the Insider: You know the answer but you don't want to reveal yourself, so use your knowledge to subtly guide the conversation with the right questions without being too obvious about it.
{% endcapture %} {% include alert.md text=text color="warning" %}

#### GAME END
The game ends if the answer is not found, then everyone loses. 

If the answer is found, however, then the timer is flipped. This elapsed time is now used to try to identify the Insider. Everyone (including the Master) discusses and tries to find the insider among them. Everyone votes for the person they think the player who guessed the word is the Insider or not. Master decides the tiebreaker.

This can have four possible outcomes:
- Majority thumbs up
  - If the guesser is Insider, Commons and Master win. 
  - If the guesser is not the Insider, Insider wins. 
- Majority thumbs down
  - If the guesser is Insider, Insider wins. 
  - If the guesser isn't Insider, a second voting occurs.

Second voting: Vote for the person who players think the Insider is. The Master decides the tiebreaker.
This can have two possible outcomes:
- If the Insider is accused, Master and Commons win.  
- If the Insider is not accused, Insider wins.
