#### Goal

Be the first player to acquire 10 victory points on your turn!

Here's how to gain victory points:
- Settlement = 1 VP 
- City = 2 VP 
- VP card = 1 VP 
- Longest Road or Larget Army = 2 VP

#### SETUP
1. Log in to the site
2. Join the newly created designated room
3. Each player begins the game by placing one settlement and one connecting road, then another settlement and another connecting road in reverse turn order.
4. Receive the resources in the terrain hexes adjacent to your second settlement. 

#### GAMEPLAY

On your turn, you will roll two dice. The number rolled determines which terrain hexes produce resources for all players. 

{% include figure.html img="terrains.png" alt="Terrain types and the resources they produce" caption="Terrain types and the resources they produce" width="75%" %}

Then, you can build roads, settlements, and cities, buy development cards, or trade with other players.

**Produce Resource**

Building settlements and cities produce resources. Resources are produced when any player does a dice roll. Whomever has a settlement or a city in the border of the dice number will receive the resource shown in the tile. Settlements produce 1 resource, cities produce 2 resources.

The dots (pips) below the numbers represent the likelihood of the number being rolled. Statistically, 6 and 8 are more likely to be rolled than 5 and 9, for instance.

{% include figure.html img="Example.png" alt="An example turn" caption="An example turn" width="75%" %}

In this example, a 10 was rolled. Yellow has one city next to the "10" pasture and two cities next to the "10" mountain, so they would receive 2 wools and 4 ores. Red has one city and one settlement next to the "10" pasture, so they would receive 3 wools.

**Rolling 7 & Robber**

When a player rolls a 7, they get to place the robber on any tile they wish and steal 1 random card from any of the colors adjacent to that tile. Robber prevents gaining resource from the tile it is on.

**Use Resources**

Resources could be used to build Road, Settlement, City, and buy Development Card.

{% include figure.html img="resources.png" alt="Resources costs for buying and building" caption="Resources costs for buying and building" width="75%" %}

Building rules:

- Roads: Only 1 road may be built on each path. A new road must be connected to your existing road, settlement, or city on the board.
- Settlements: You can only build a new settlement on an unoccupied intersection if you have a road leading to that intersection and the nearest settlement is at least two intersections away. 
- Cities: Cities cannot be built directly. You can only upgrade an existing settlement to a city. 


**Development Cards (25)**

Development cards cannot be traded or stole. You may only play 1 development card during your turn. You can play the card at any time, even before you roll the dice. You may not, however, play a card that you bought during the same turn. Victory point cards are only revealed when the game is over, either you or an opponent reaches 10 or more victory points and declares victory.
- Knight (14): Place robber in any tile and steal 1 card from an adjacent tile.
- Year of Plenty (2): Take any 2 resource cards you want from the bank.
- Road Building (2): Build 2 free roads.
- Monopoly (2): Steal all resources of a single type from every player.
- Victory Point (5): Gain 1 victory point.

**Trade**

You can trade with other players. Make them an offer that they cannot refuse!

Bank: On default you can give 4 of the same type of card to obtain 1 of any other type.

Bank with Ports: If you have a settlement or city near a port you automatically use that ports specialty. If you have 3:1 it means that you can trade 3 of the same type of card to obtain 1 of any other type. If you have 2:1, then you can trade 2 of the corresponding type to obtain 1 of any other card.

**Longest Road**

The player with the longest contiguous road earns 2 victory points. A minimum of 5 consecutive roads need to be placed in order to get this bonus. The Longest Road may be overtaken when another player builds a longer road.

**Largest Army**

The player to use the most amount of Knight cards earns 2 victory points. A minimum of 3 Knight cards needs to be used in order to get this bonus. The largest army may be overtaken when another player builds a larger army.

#### GAME END
The game ends when the first player acquired 10 victory points on their turn wins the game.
